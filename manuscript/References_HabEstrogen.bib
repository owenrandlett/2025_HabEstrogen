               which would require knowledge of the time-varying activity of
               all neurons in the central nervous system. Here we use
               light-sheet microscopy to record activity, reported through the

               reveal functionally defined circuits across the brain, we
               identify two populations of neurons with correlated activity
               patterns. One circuit consists of hindbrain neurons functionally
               coupled to spinal cord neuropil. The other consists of an

               with activity in the left and right halves oscillating in
               antiphase, on a timescale of 20 s, and coupled to equally slow
               oscillations in the inferior olive.},

  abstract  = {Memory comprises acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of
               information. Many substances can influence these different
               phases. It is well demonstrated that sex hormones, mainly
               estrogen, impact cognitive function. More recently, progesterone
               has also been documented as playing an important role in
               cognition, since it influences brain regions involved in memory.
               Currently, many women are under hormone treatment, which contain
               progesterone to decrease the risk of development of endometrial
               cancer. This affords the opportunity to study the real effects
               of this hormonal replacement on cognition. There are many
               contradictory results regarding the role of progesterone in
               memory. Therefore, the aim of this review was to synthesize
               these studies using the new perspective of the influence of

  title    = {Locomotor repertoire of the larval zebrafish: swimming, turning
              and prey capture},
  author   = {Budick, S A and O'Malley, D M},
  abstract = {Larval zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) are a popular model system
              because of their genetic attributes, transparency and relative
              simplicity. They have approximately 200 neurons that project from
              the brainstem into the spinal cord. Many of these neurons can be
              individually identified and laser-ablated in intact larvae. This
              should facilitate cellular-level characterization of the
              descending control of larval behavior patterns. Towards this end,
              we attempt to describe the range of locomotor behavior patterns
              exhibited by zebrafish larvae. Using high-speed digital imaging,
              a variety of swimming and turning behaviors were analyzed in 6-
              to 9-day-old larval fish. Swimming episodes appeared to fall into
              two categories, with the point of maximal bending of the larva's
              body occurring either near the mid-body (burst swims) or closer
              to the tail (slow swims). Burst swims also involved
              larger-amplitude bending, faster speeds and greater yaw than slow
              swims. Turning behaviors clearly fell into two distinct
              categories: fast, large-angle escape turns characteristic of
              escape responses, and much slower routine turns lacking the large
              counterbend that often accompanies escape turns. Prey-capture
              behaviors were also recorded. They were made up of simpler
              locomotor components that appeared to be similar to routine turns
              and slow swims. The different behaviors observed were analyzed
              with regard to possible underlying neural control systems. Our
              analysis suggests the existence of discrete sets of controlling
              neurons and helps to explain the need for the roughly 200
              spinal-projecting nerve cells in the brainstem of the larval
              zebrafish.},

  abstract  = {Rodents rely heavily on odor detection, discrimination, and
               memory to locate food, find mates, care for pups, and avoid
               predators. Estrogens have been shown to increase memory
               retention in rodents performing spatial memory and object
               placement tasks. Here we evaluate the extent to which
               17$\beta$-estradiol modulates memory formation and duration in
               the olfactory system. Adult CD-1 mice were gonadectomized and
               given either systemic 17$\beta$-estradiol replacement, local
               17$\beta$-estradiol in the main olfactory bulb, or no
               replacement. Before performing the behavioral task the mice were
               given saline or PHTPP (an estrogen receptor $\beta$ [ER-$\beta$]
               antagonist) via bilateral infusion into the main olfactory bulb.
               As the beta-type estrogen receptor (ER-$\beta$) is more abundant
               than the alpha-type estrogen receptor in the murine main
               olfactory bulb, the current study focuses on 17$\beta$-estradiol
               and its interactions with ER$\beta$. Habituation, a simple,
               nonassociative learning task in which an animal is exposed to
               the same odor over successive presentations, was used to
               evaluate the animals' ability to detect odors and form an
               olfactory memory. To evaluate memory duration, we added a final
               trial of intertrial interval time (30 or 60 min) in which we
               presented the habituated odor. Neither surgical nor drug
               manipulation affected the ability of mice to detect or habituate
               to an odor. After habituation, gonadectomized
               17$\beta$-estradiol-treated mice retained memory of an odor for
               30 min, whereas non-estradiol-treated,
               17$\beta$-estradiol+ER$\beta$ antagonist (PHTPP), and untreated
               male mice did not remember an odor 30 min after habituation. The
               results show that both systemic and local bulbar infusions of
               17$\beta$-estradiol enhance odor memory duration in mice.},

               We mapped the structure of larval zebrafish swim trajectories in
               homogeneous environments and found that trajectories were
               characterized by alternating sequences of repeated turns to the
               left and to the right. Using whole-brain light-sheet imaging, we
               identified activity relating to the behavior in specific neural
               populations that we termed the anterior rhombencephalic turning
               region (ARTR). ARTR perturbations biased swim direction and
               reduced the dependence of turn direction on turn history,
               indicating that the ARTR is part of a network generating the

  abstract  = {The influence of melatonin on hippocampal evoked potentials
               initiated by low- and high-frequency electrical stimulations and
               by two pulses applied in rapid succession was investigated. In
               confirmation of our previous studies, melatonin attenuated the
               population spike triggered by low-frequency stimulation (0.03
               Hz). High-frequency stimulation (HFS; 100 Hz for 1 sec, three
               times every 10 sec), which in control slices permanently
               facilitated neuronal excitability (347\% +/- 32\%), was also
               able to amplify the melatonin-depressed potential (467.8\% +/-
               59.6\%). Because melatonin is a hydrophobic molecule, it was
               dissolved and applied in ethanol. Ethanol (0.4\%) by itself
               reduced the magnitude of HFS-induced potentiation (233.5\% +/-
               16.8\%). The slices stimulated with two pulses separated with a
               delay longer than 15 msec demonstrated a facilitation of the
               response to the second stimuli (paired-pulse facilitation; PPF).
               The influence of melatonin (100 microM) on PPF was biphasic:
               Shortly after addition of melatonin, PPF was briefly (5-10 min)
               reversed to paired-pulse inhibition (PPI), which gradually
               returned to a stable PPF. Ethanol (0.4\%) applied without
               melatonin exerted only a marginal, facilitatory effect on PPF.
               The delay between two successively applied pulses, shorter than
               13 msec, resulted in attenuation of the response to the second
               stimuli (PPI). Melatonin (100 microM) reversed the attenuation
               of the second potential within 15-20 min following its
               application. Ethanol applied by itself at the concentration of
               0.4\% temporarily (5-10 min), but significantly, depressed the
               second potential. These results demonstrate the ability of
               melatonin to modulate specific forms of plasticity in

  abstract  = {Estrogen rapidly activates the mitogen-activated protein
               kinases, Erk-1 and Erk-2, via an as yet unknown mechanism. Here,
               evidence is provided that estrogen-induced Erk-1/-2 activation
               occurs independently of known estrogen receptors, but requires
               the expression of the G protein-coupled receptor homolog, GPR30.
               We show that 17beta-estradiol activates Erk-1/-2 not only in
               MCF-7 cells, which express both estrogen receptor alpha (ER
               alpha) and ER beta, but also in SKBR3 breast cancer cells, which
               fail to express either receptor. Immunoblot analysis using GPR30
               peptide antibodies showed that this estrogen response was
               associated with the presence of GPR30 protein in these cells.
               MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (ER alpha-, ER beta+) are GPR30
               deficient and insensitive to Erk-1/-2 activation by
               17beta-estradiol. Transfection of MDA-MB-231 cells with a GPR30
               complementary DNA resulted in overexpression of GPR30 protein
               and conversion to an estrogen-responsive phenotype. In addition,
               GPR30-dependent Erk-1/-2 activation was triggered by ER
               antagonists, including ICI 182,780, yet not by 17alpha-estradiol
               or progesterone. Consistent with acting through a G
               protein-coupled receptor, estradiol signaling to Erk-1/-2
               occurred via a Gbetagamma-dependent, pertussis toxin-sensitive
               pathway that required Src-related tyrosine kinase activity and
               tyrosine phosphorylation of tyrosine 317 of the Shc adapter
               protein. Reinforcing this idea, estradiol signaling to Erk-1/-2
               was dependent upon trans-activation of the epidermal growth
               factor (EGF) receptor via release of heparan-bound EGF (HB-EGF).
               Estradiol signaling to Erk-1/-2 could be blocked by: 1)
               inhibiting EGF-receptor tyrosine kinase activity, 2)
               neutralizing HB-EGF with antibodies, or 3) down-modulating
               HB-EGF from the cell surface with the diphtheria toxin mutant,
               CRM-197. Our data imply that ER-negative breast tumors that
               continue to express GPR30 may use estrogen to drive growth
               factor-dependent cellular responses.},

               neuromodulators. One of these is estradiol, a steroid hormone
               that is synthesized both in peripheral endocrine tissue and in
               the brain, including the hippocampus. Here, we examine the
               evidence regarding the role of estradiol in the hippocampus,
               specifically, in memory formation and its effects on the
               molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity. We conclude
               that estradiol improves memory consolidation and, thereby,
               long-term memory. Previous studies have shown that it does this
               in three, interconnected ways: (1) via functional changes in
               excitatory activity, (2) signaling changes in calcium dynamics,
               protein phosphorylation and protein expression, and (3)
               structural changes to synaptic morphology. Through a functional
               network analysis of proteins affected by estradiol, we identify
               potential protein-protein interactions that further support a
               role for estradiol in modulating synaptic plasticity as well as
               highlight signaling pathways that may be involved in these
               changes within the hippocampus.},

              brain, such as dendritic spine formation, remodeling of synaptic
              plasticity, cognition, neurotransmission, and neurodevelopment.
              Estrogen interacts with intracellular estrogen receptors (ERs)
              and membrane-bound ERs to produce its effect via genomic and
              non-genomic pathways. Any alterations in these pathways affect
              the number, size, and shape of dendritic spines in neurons
              associated with psychiatric diseases. Increasing evidence
              suggests that estrogen fluctuation causes changes in dendritic
              spine density, morphology, and synapse numbers of excitatory and
              inhibitory neurons differently in males and females. In this
              review, we discuss the role of estrogen hormone in rodents and
              humans based on sex differences. First, we explain estrogen role
              in learning and memory and show that a high estrogen level
              alleviates the deficits in learning and memory. Secondly, we
              point out that estrogen produces a striking difference in
              emotional memories in men and women, which leads them to display
              sex-specific differences in underlying neuronal signaling.
              Lastly, we discuss that fluctuations in estrogen levels in men
              and women are related to neuropsychiatric disorders, including
              schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit

               genes are related to timing of hippocampal mnemonic processes
               (acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of long-term memory
               [LTM]) and long-term potentiation (LTP), little is known about
               temporal gating mechanisms. Here, the role of the neurohormone
               melatonin as a circadian time cue for hippocampal signaling and
               memory formation was investigated in C3H/He wildtype (WT) and
               melatonin receptor-knockout ( MT 1 / 2 - / - ) mice.
               Immunohistochemical and immunoblot analyses revealed the
               presence of melatonin receptors on mouse hippocampal neurons.
               Temporal patterns of time-of-day-dependent clock gene protein
               levels were profoundly altered in MT 1 / 2 - / - mice compared
               to WT animals. On the behavioral level, WT mice displayed better
               spatial learning efficiency during daytime as compared to
               nighttime. In contrast, high error scores were observed in MT 1
               / 2 - / - mice during both, daytime and nighttime acquisition.
               Day-night difference in LTP, as observed in WT mice, was absent
               in MT 1 / 2 - / - mice and in WT animals, in which the
               sympathetic innervation of the pineal gland was surgically
               removed to erase rhythmic melatonin synthesis. In addition,
               treatment of melatonin-deficient C57BL/6 mice with melatonin at
               nighttime significantly improved their working memory
               performance at daytime. These results illustrate that melatonin
               shapes time-of-day-dependent learning efficiency in parallel to
               consolidating expression patterns of clock genes in the mouse
               hippocampus. Our data suggest that melatonin imprints a time cue
               on mouse hippocampal signaling and gene expression to foster
               better learning during daytime.},

               inconsequential stimuli. Despite being the most basic form of
               learning, a consensus model on the underlying mechanisms has yet
               to emerge. To probe relevant mechanisms, we took advantage of a
               visual habituation paradigm in larval zebrafish, where larvae
               reduce their reactions to abrupt global dimming (a dark flash).
               We used Ca2+ imaging during repeated dark flashes and identified
               12 functional classes of neurons that differ based on their rate
               of adaptation, stimulus response shape, and anatomical location.
               While most classes of neurons depressed their responses to
               repeated stimuli, we identified populations that did not adapt
               or that potentiated their response. These neurons were
               distributed across brain areas, consistent with a distributed
               learning process. Using a small-molecule screening approach, we
               confirmed that habituation manifests from multiple distinct
               molecular mechanisms, and we have implicated molecular pathways
               in habituation, including melatonin, oestrogen, and GABA
               signalling. However, by combining anatomical analyses and
               pharmacological manipulations with Ca2+ imaging, we failed to
               identify a simple relationship between pharmacology, altered
               activity patterns, and habituation behaviour. Collectively, our
               work indicates that habituation occurs via a complex and
               distributed plasticity processes that cannot be captured by a
               simple model. Therefore, untangling the mechanisms of
               habituation will likely require dedicated approaches aimed at
               sub-component mechanisms underlying this multidimensional
               learning process.},

               Homozygous nacre (nac(w2)) mutants lack melanophores throughout
               development but have increased numbers of iridophores. The
               non-crest-derived retinal pigment epithelium is normal,
               suggesting that the mutation does not affect pigment synthesis
               per se. Expression of early melanoblast markers is absent in
               nacre mutants and transplant experiments suggested a
               cell-autonomous function in melanophores. We show that nac(w2)
               is a mutation in a zebrafish gene encoding a basic
               helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factor related to
               microphthalmia (Mitf), a gene known to be required for

               Transient expression of the wild-type nacre gene restored

               on the nacre/Mitf transcription factor, but that proper
               development of the retinal pigment epithelium in the fish is not

               Ovx rats. Performance of treated rats was also enhanced in

               Working, reference, and working-reference memory was examined
               when four of the eight arms were baited, and only working memory
               was improved by estrogen and only after long-term treatment.

  abstract  = {The advent of methods for optical imaging of large-scale neural
               activity at cellular resolution in behaving animals presents the
               problem of identifying behavior-encoding cells within the
               resulting image time series. Rapid and precise identification of
               cells with particular neural encoding would facilitate targeted
               activity measurements and perturbations useful in characterizing
               the operating principles of neural circuits. Here we report a
               regression-based approach to semiautomatically identify neurons
               that is based on the correlation of fluorescence time series
               with quantitative measurements of behavior. The approach is
               illustrated with a novel preparation allowing synchronous eye
               tracking and two-photon laser scanning fluorescence imaging of
               calcium changes in populations of hindbrain neurons during
               spontaneous eye movement in the larval zebrafish. Putative
               velocity-to-position oculomotor integrator neurons were
               identified that showed a broad spatial distribution and
               diversity of encoding. Optical identification of integrator
               neurons was confirmed with targeted loose-patch electrical
               recording and laser ablation. The general regression-based
               approach we demonstrate should be widely applicable to calcium
               imaging time series in behaving animals.},

                 several generations of development, computational methods to
                 process the resulting movies remain inefficient and can give
                 results that are hard to interpret. Here we introduce Suite2p:
                 a fast, accurate and complete pipeline that registers raw
                 movies, detects active cells, extracts their calcium traces
                 and infers their spike times. Suite2p runs on standard
                 workstations, operates faster than real time, and recovers ~2
                 times more cells than the previous state-of-the-art method.
                 Its low computational load allows routine detection of ~10,000

              protect against cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological
              diseases and are involved in hormone-sensitive cancers such as
              breast cancer. Oestrogens and oestrogen mimetics mediate their
              effects via the cytosolic and nuclear receptors oestrogen
              receptor-$\alpha$ (ER$\alpha$) and oestrogen receptor-$\beta$
              (ER$\beta$) and membrane subpopulations as well as the

              GPER, which dates back more than 450 million years in evolution,
              mediates both rapid signalling and transcriptional regulation.
              Oestrogen mimetics (such as phytooestrogens and xenooestrogens

  abstract  = {Habituation is a simple form of learning where animals learn to
               reduce their responses to repeated innocuous stimuli [1].
               Habituation is thought to occur via at least two temporally and
               molecularly distinct mechanisms, which lead to short-term
               memories that last for seconds to minutes and long-term memories
               that last for hours or longer [1, 2]. Here, we focus on
               long-term habituation, which, due to the extended time course,
               necessitates stable alterations to circuit properties [2-4]. In
               its simplest form, long-term habituation could result from a
               plasticity event at a single point in a circuit, and many
               studies have focused on identifying the site and underlying
               mechanism of plasticity [5-10]. However, it is possible that
               these individual sites are only one of many points in the
               circuit where plasticity is occurring. Indeed, studies of
               short-term habituation in C. elegans indicate that in this
               paradigm, multiple genetically separable mechanisms operate to
               adapt specific aspects of behavior [11-13]. Here, we use a
               visual assay in which larval zebrafish habituate their response
               to sudden reductions in illumination (dark flashes) [14, 15].
               Through behavioral analyses, we find that multiple components of
               the dark-flash response habituate independently of one another
               using different molecular mechanisms. This is consistent with a
               modular model in which habituation originates from multiple
               independent processes, each adapting specific components of
               behavior. This may allow animals to more specifically or
               flexibly habituate based on stimulus context or internal states.},

               species and paradigms, met to discuss their work on habituation
               and to revisit and refine the characteristics of habituation.
               This review offers a re-evaluation of the characteristics of
               habituation in light of these discussions. We made substantial
               changes to only a few of the characteristics, usually to add new

               substantially alter the original point. One additional

               descending excitatory connections to central pattern generators
               in the spinal cord. To investigate how these inputs determine
               locomotor kinematics, we used whole-field visual motion to drive
               zebrafish to swim at different speeds. Larvae match the stimulus
               speed by utilizing more locomotor events, or modifying kinematic
               parameters such as the duration and speed of swimming bouts, the
               tail-beat frequency, and the choice of gait. We used laser
               ablations, electrical stimulation, and activity recordings in
               descending neurons of the nucleus of the medial longitudinal
               fasciculus (nMLF) to dissect their contribution to controlling
               forward movement. We found that the activity of single
               identified neurons within the nMLF is correlated with locomotor
               kinematics, and modulates both the duration and oscillation
               frequency of tail movements. By identifying the contribution of
               individual supraspinal circuit elements to locomotion

               interfacing with external devices and simultaneous real-time
               tracking of behavioral parameters such as position, orientation,
               tail and eye motion in both freely-swimming and head-restrained

               code version in standardized formats to allow full provenance
               tracking, from data acquisition through analysis to publication.
               The package is modular and expandable for different experimental
               protocols and setups. Current releases can be found at
               https://github.com/portugueslab/stytra. We also provide complete
               documentation with examples for extending the package to new
               stimuli and hardware, as well as a schema and parts list for
               behavioral setups. We showcase Stytra by reproducing previously
               published behavioral protocols in both head-restrained and
               freely-swimming larvae. We also demonstrate the use of the
               software in the context of a calcium imaging experiment, where

  abstract  = {Tools enabling closed-loop experiments are crucial to delineate
               causal relationships between the activity of genetically labeled
               neurons and specific behaviors. We developed the Raspberry Pi
               Virtual Reality (PiVR) system to conduct closed-loop optogenetic
               stimulation of neural functions in unrestrained animals. PiVR is
               an experimental platform that operates at high temporal
               resolution (70 Hz) with low latencies (<30 milliseconds), while
               being affordable (<US\$500) and easy to build (<6 hours).
               Through extensive documentation, this tool was designed to be
               accessible to a wide public, from high school students to
               professional researchers studying systems neuroscience. We
               illustrate the functionality of PiVR by focusing on sensory
               navigation in response to gradients of chemicals (chemotaxis)
               and light (phototaxis). We show how Drosophila adult flies
               perform negative chemotaxis by modulating their locomotor speed
               to avoid locations associated with optogenetically evoked bitter
               taste. In Drosophila larvae, we use innate positive chemotaxis
               to compare behavior elicited by real- and virtual-odor
               gradients. Finally, we examine how positive phototaxis emerges
               in zebrafish larvae from the modulation of turning maneuvers to
               orient in virtual white-light gradients. Besides its application
               to study chemotaxis and phototaxis, PiVR is a versatile tool

               characterize neural circuits.},

               in a feedback loop, yet the neural substrate underlying this
               sensorimotor task in the vertebrate brain remains elusive. Here,
               we combine virtual-reality behavioural assays, volumetric
               calcium imaging, optogenetic stimulation and circuit modelling
               to reveal the neural mechanisms through which a zebrafish
               performs phototaxis, i.e. actively orients towards a light
               source. Key to this process is a self-oscillating hindbrain
               population (HBO) that acts as a pacemaker for ocular saccades
               and controls the orientation of successive swim-bouts. It
               further integrates visual stimuli in a state-dependent manner,
               i.e. its response to visual inputs varies with the motor
               context, a mechanism that manifests itself in the phase-locked
               entrainment of the HBO by periodic stimuli. A rate model is

Here we present an automated high-throughput system for measuring nonassociative learning behaviors in larval zebrafish. Using this system, we report that spaced training blocks of repetitive visual stimuli elicit protein synthesis–dependent long-term habituation in larval zebrafish, lasting up to 24 h. Moreover, repetitive acoustic stimulation induces robust short-term habituation that can be modulated by stimulation frequency and instantaneously dishabituated through cross-modal stimulation. To characterize the neurochemical pathways underlying short-term habituation, we screened 1,760 bioactive compounds with known targets. Although we found extensive functional conservation of short-term learning between larval zebrafish and mammalian models, we also discovered several compounds with previously unknown roles in learning. These compounds included a myristic acid analog known to interact with Src family kinases and an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase 2, demonstrating that high-throughput chemical screens combined with high-resolution behavioral assays provide a powerful approach for the discovery of novel cognitive modulators.},

               (100 ng/g, 1 $\mu$g/g, 10 $\mu$g/g) and involvement of the
               estrogen receptors (ERs) using selective ER agonists on the
               consolidation of object recognition (OR) and object placement
               memory (OP) in adult male zebrafish. The general activation of
               ERs with the highest E2 dose improved consolidation of memory in
               both learning tasks within 1.45 h of administration. Activation
               of classical ERs (ER$\alpha$ and ER$\beta$) improved
               consolidation of OR memory, but had no effect on fish
               performance in OP task. On the other hand, activation of G
               protein-coupled ER1 impaired and enhanced consolidation of OR
               and OP memories, respectively. Memory improvement in both tasks
               was accompanied by a marked up-regulation in the expression of
               genes encoding ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors
               in a task-dependent manner. In contrast, the down-regulation in

               therapy, with onset typically within weeks to months after
               initiation. Worldwide, more than 100 million pre-menopausal
               women use combined oral contraceptives, with tens to hundreds of
               thousands developing thrombosis annually, resulting in
               significant morbidity and mortality. Although it is known that
               estrogens can alter expression of coagulation factors, the
               pathways and mechanisms that connect the two systems, as well as
               the proteins involved in progression to thrombosis, are poorly
               understood. Identification of these mediators are central to any
               comprehensive understanding of hormone-induced pathophysiology,
               could help ascertain patients at higher risk for thrombosis, and
               may also pinpoint future therapeutic targets. The zebrafish is a
               powerful genetic model in which the hemostatic system is almost
               entirely conserved with humans. Its external development,
               ability to generate thousands of offspring at low cost, and
               optical transparency all make it a powerful tool to study the
               genetics of coagulation disorders. We previously produced a
               transgenic line (fgb-egfp) that generates GFP-tagged fibrinogen
               that labels induced and spontaneous fibrin-rich thrombi. Here we
               show rapid onset of thrombosis after exposure to various
               estrogens, but not progestins or testosterone. Thrombi are
               localized to the venous system, develop broadly along the
               posterior cardinal vein, and show evidence for clot contraction.
               Thrombosis is only partially impeded by anticoagulants, occurs
               in the absence of factor X and prothrombin, but is completely
               blocked in the absence of fibrinogen. Furthermore, although an
               estrogen receptor antagonist is partially inhibitory, targeted
               knockout of all known estrogen receptors does not eliminate
               thrombosis. These data suggest that zebrafish can be used to
               model human estrogen-induced thrombosis, although the lack of
               dependence on the canonical coagulation cascade is surprising.
               The inability to completely inhibit thrombosis through
               genetic/pharmacologic anticoagulation or estrogen receptor
               disruption suggests that the mechanisms may be multifactorial.
               We hypothesize that thrombi are composed of fibrin(ogen)
               aggregates rather than purely fibrin. Results of further studies
               could lead to novel therapeutic targets and ascertain patients
               at higher risk for thrombosis.",

               is evident in hypoestrogenic states (e.g., postmenopause) in
               which many of these functions go awry. The actions of E2 in the
               brain have been attributed to the activation of estrogen
               receptors alpha and beta through nuclear, cytoplasmic, or
               membrane actions. However, we have identified a putative
               membrane-associated estrogen receptor that is coupled to
               desensitization of GABAB and mu-opioid receptors in guinea pig
               and mouse hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin neurons. We have
               synthesized a new nonsteroidal compound, STX, which selectively

               Both E2 and STX were fully efficacious in estrogen receptor

               spatial learning and memory consolidation was impaired by GPER1
               deficiency in both sexes. Notably, in the females, spatial

               mice were in a stage of the estrous cycle, in which E2 serum
               levels are high (proestrus) or rising (diestrus). On the

               progress has been made towards understanding the molecular
               mechanisms through which 17$\beta$-estradiol (E2) regulates

               Second, we investigated in vivo and in vitro the mechanisms

               means of whole-mount hybridization and immunohistochemistry on

               analyzed with hierarchical clustering followed by biological
               process and tissue enrichment analysis. Markedly distinct sets
               of genes were up and down-regulated by E2 at the four different
               time points. Among these genes, only the well-known estrogenic
               marker vtg1 was co-regulated at all time points. Despite this,
               the biological functional categories targeted by E2 were

               to knowledge-based tissue enrichment, estrogen responsive genes

               biomarkers for exposure to estrogens or estrogenic endocrine
